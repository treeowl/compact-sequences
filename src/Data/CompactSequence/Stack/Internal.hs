Debit invariant: We allow the Stack in each Two node as many debits as there
are elements in its array and those of all previous Two nodes.

We derive Functor and Traversable, at least for now, even though the derived
fmap and traverse can produce extra thunks below Two nodes. For Functor, there
seems to be no possible advantage to being stricter, except possibly to get
more consistent performance with different stack shapes--all we could do would
be to push the thunks to the leaves, which is really always worse. I suspect
the same is true for traverse, but I'm not entirely sure.

Empty is always trivial.

One: We increase the debit allowance below.

Two: We reduce the debit allowance of some nodes below by 2. We pay 2*log n to
discharge the excess debits.

Three: This is the tricky case for `cons`. We have some number of Three
nodes followed by something else. For each `Three` node, we suspend `s/4`
array-doubling work. We pay for that using the additional debit allowance
we gain from the elements in the new `Two` node. When we reach the end
of the `Three` chain, we have either `Empty`, `One`, or `Two`. If we have
`Empty` or `One`, we're done. If we have `Two`, then changing that to
`Three` reduces the debit allowance below. But we also *gain* debit allowance
below, from all the `Three`s that have changed to `Two`s! Our net loss
debit allowance is just 1, so we're golden.

Three Three Two more
-> Two Two Three more
`more` starts with a debit allowance of 8. The Three node in the
result has a debit allowance of 6. We suspend 3/2 array-doubling
work total and pass the debits from the `Stack` in the last `Two`
up to the one in the first `Two`.

Three Three Three Two more
-> Two Two Two Three more
`more` starts witha  debit allowance of 16. The Three node in the
result has a debit allowance of 14. We suspend 7/2 array doubling
work. Of that, 1/2 is in the first Two, 2/2 is in the second Two,
and 4/2 is in the last Two; we pass the debits on the last up, to
get 2/2 in the first Two and 4/2 in the second.

Cases:
Empty is trivial.
`Three`: we increase the debit allowance below.
`Two`: We reduce the debit allowance on certain nodes by 2; pay 2*log n to discharge that.
`One`: This is the hard case. We have some number of `One` nodes followed by something else.
For each `One`, we perform a split. We place debits to pay for those, discharging the ones
at the root. At the end, we have a situation similar to that for `cons`: the tricky case
is ending in `Two`, where we use the fact that all the new `Two`s pay for the loss of the
final `Two`.
